Note: This is a placeholder file. 
Please replace this with the actual Google icon image (google_icon.png).
You can download the official Google "G" logo from:
https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines

For now, the app will show an error for the missing image.
You can temporarily use any square image as a placeholder.
